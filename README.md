Bobcat Bites is a Flask full-stack web application that provides busy students of Texas State with three different on-campus food recommendation tools to use that factor in their dining preferences and restrictions.

For the Search Recommendation, the results will be based entirely on your search query, it will provide results filtering out results from your allergens and your saved list. The Random Recommendation will recommend food items randomly, filtering out results based on allergens and your saved list. If you choose to leave to another part of the website, your progress is reset. Recommendation by Restaurant will populate with results for a particular restaurant, filtering out results based on allergens and your saved list. If you choose to leave to another part of the website, progress is reset (also is reset if you reach the end of the list)
